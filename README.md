# FanSync

## Inspiration

We noticed that many concerts and sporting events use a lot of wasteful products to try and improve engagement among fans; also, these products may be wasteful and our team figured a more impactful and sustainable solution to fan engagement could be created using technology.

## What it does

FANSYNC connects and coordinates fans from around a stadium by displaying intricate graphics on a user's phone. When a ticket is scanned, the application is able to pinpoint the location of a fan in the venue and turn the stadium into a beautiful cheering artwork.

This project was build for [TOhacks.](https://tohacks2022.devpost.com/) View the [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQZS6zPs-6o&ab_channel=JustinGu) or the [devpost submission.](https://devpost.com/software/fansync)

## How we built it
Video processing was done using python and the OpenCV library. The video is turned into json file format with each individual RGB value for each pixel then sent to every phone. Demo was created with react js.

## Challenges we ran into
Assembly AI was tough to use but we're glad we were exposed to new technology. In the end we did not end up incorporating it.

## Tools Used
- OpenCV
